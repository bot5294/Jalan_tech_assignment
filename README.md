***Question 1:
Write a program that takes as input a sorted array of numbers. The objective is to return the array arranged in an 
alternate order such that max value is followed by min value in a descending fashion, so that the 1st element is the 
max value, 2nd element is the min value, 3rd element is the second max value, 4th element is the second min value & 
so on.
Example: For an input array [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], 
the expected result would be [10, 2, 8, 4, 6]
Note: The solution should modify the original array itself.***

***Question 2:
Please implement a software for a Coffee House using Object Oriented Programming. If you are not familiar or 
comfortable with object-oriented programming, we suggest you give this article a quick read to ensure you 
understand it before you attempt it.
It should have the following features:***
- Allow users to order a coffee from Espresso, Cappuccino, Latte.
- Allow users to specify add-ons: Milk, Cream, Latte
Prices for the available options are as follows:

|Product/Add-on| Milk | Cream | Latte |
|---|---|---|---|
| Espresso | 60 | 75 | 100 |
| Cappuccino | 80 | 90 | 125 |
| Latte | 100 | 125 | 150 |

***We need to define the solution as follows:***
1. Display the combination of coffees that can be ordered
2. Allow users to choose their coffee type with the preferred add-on.
3. Generate the detailed bill/receipt with the amount to be paid.
4. Allow users to order more than 1 cup and more than 1 variety.
